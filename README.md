MaestroTrajectoryMaker
======================

MATLAB tools to create trajectories for MAESTRO. Includes inverse kinematic solvers for Hubo's arms and legs that convert xyz position to joint angles to be added to a trajectory file. Documentation will come. For now refer to test.m for a general overview of how to use this repository.
